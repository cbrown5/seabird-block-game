## Game play

The game board consists of an 8(h) x 4 (w) grid. Each grid has an arrow pointing in a random direction on it (use emojis). Some grids have fish instead of arrows. The aim is to get the seabird to the fish. The player has to make a path for the bird. The play can click or tap on a grid to spin the arrow on that grid. Once they have lined up a pathway to a fish they can click on a fish and the bird will fly that far and get the fish. Then the bird returns directly home with the fish. 

The bird has to collect three fish then it layes an egg. A count down timer starts until the egg hatches (5s). Once the egg is hatched the bird needs to feed the chick three times to fledge the chick. The player has 10 seconds to feed the chick each time. The timer resets when the bird feeds the chick. If the player doesn't feed the chick in time the chick dies and game play is over. 

If the player successfully feeds the chick three times chick fledges and the player wins. 

There are also fishing boats. Fishing boats leave a port and travel towards the nearest fish. They can travel any direction regardless of the arrows. Each fishing boat can catch three fish before it needs to return to port.
